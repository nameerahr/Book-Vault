# Book-Vault

This is a dynamic web application built to assist users in keeping track of their reading materials such as books on their current list and completed books. The frontend was developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the backend used Python, the Flask framework as well as stored user libraries in an SQLite database. The application leverages the Open Library Search API to provide users with a large selection of books to search for and add to their libraries. Once in their library, users are able to organize their books within different categories, creating an an easy solution to efficiently manage their reads.
